# PhotoGallery

This single-page application (SPA) was built to manage photos from the web, and it uses:
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) for client-side code
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) as the JavaScript runtime environment
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the container build
- [CSS](https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS/#css) (layout and styling)
